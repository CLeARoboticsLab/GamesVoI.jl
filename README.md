## Installation

This package uses the proprietary PATH solver under the hood (via [PATHSolver.jl](https://github.com/chkwon/PATHSolver.jl)).
Therefore, you will need a license key to solve larger problems.
However, by courtesy of Steven Dirkse, Michael Ferris, and Tudd Munson,
[temporary licenses are available free of charge](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ferris/path.html).
Please consult the documentation of [PATHSolver.jl](https://github.com/chkwon/PATHSolver.jl) to learn about loading the license key.
